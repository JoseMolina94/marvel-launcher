# marvel-launcher

Hello!, I welcome you to this mini test project.

To start it you must follow the following steps:

1- Run the command "npm i" or "npm install" in the terminal of your IDE

2- Execute the "npm run dev" command from NextJS, to be able to visualize the project

3- If your browser does not open automatically, this project runs on localhost:3000

- Thank you -
